## Github
Please create an account on this Site [GitHub](https://github.com) </br> You can follow me on [Author](https://github.com/su33u1411)</br> Fork Class1 Repository [Class 1](https://github.com/su33u1411/Class1)
</br>
Download Class1 Project via GIT Command
</br>
Open Terminal, Use the following commands

```
cd ./Desktop
mkdir Java_Class1
git clone <YOUR_REPOSIORTY_LINK>

```
Now you should have your own working copy.


## Java JVM
* Technical definition: The JVM is the specification for a software program that executes code and provides the runtime environment for that code.
* Everyday definition: The JVM is how we run our Java programs. We configure the JVM's settings and then rely on it to manage program resources during execution.
* Memory Management

## Packages
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
User-defined Packages (create your own packages)


* Create a new Java Project on eclipse and create a new class <ClassName>.java

## Java Main
public static void main(String[] args)

Java main method is the entry point of any java program. Its syntax is always public static void main(String[] args). You can only change the name of String array argument, for example you can change args to myStringArgs.

* Create a Main method inside a Java Class

## Print a String
* Print a 'Hello World' using System.out.println()
